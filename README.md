## Summary

This MOD was formerly created to update some Japanese translation of BZ mods when the development of these MODs were dormant.  But since it has restarted in 2023/12, the purpose of this MOD is now only to provide Japanese translation of [Noble Metals (bzgold)](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzgold).
