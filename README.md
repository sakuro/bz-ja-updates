## Summary

This MOD updates some Japanese translation of BZ mods.

Though I have made some PRs for these updates, the development of BZ mods appears inactive since May 2023.  So add this MOD for interim fixes.

It also contains Japanese translation of [Noble Metals (bzgold)](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzgold).
